        "description": "The Weald is a dense, thorny forest that envelops the estate, exuding an unnerving atmosphere filled with eerie rustling, unknown movements, and the horrific, unnatural shrieks of birds. This foreboding place is overrun by brigands, corrupted animals, malevolent natural forces, and fungus-infected people."
