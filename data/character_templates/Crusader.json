    "summary": "The Crusader, a stoic warrior, reluctantly left his family to join the holy war, finding unexpected solace and divine purpose in the midst of battle. Upon returning, he found a loving wife and child, but abandons them once more, choosing his life as a soldier over that of a father, a decision that still haunts him. As a way to atone for his past, he seeks and has found a new cause under the Heir and Heiress.",
    "history": "From tilling the land to relishing the fervor of the Crusade, the Crusader's life is marked by the weight of martial glory and the stark absence of domestic warmth. Having once sought to prevent famine by his departure, he now recognizes the battlefield as his true home, forsaking the hearth for the harsh camaraderie of war. The memory of the family he abandoned haunts him, driving him to seek redemption through his new cause.",
