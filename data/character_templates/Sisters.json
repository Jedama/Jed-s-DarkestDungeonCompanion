    "summary": "The sisters are composed of The Scholar (the first name) and the Warrior (the second name), who are two souls bound to one body, which both claim to be the rightful owner of. The Scholar often maintains control, but the Warrior is able to seize autonomy of the body, primarily when there is blood to shed. Their shared past is marked by tragedy, rivalry, and a mysterious massacre. Refer to the Sisters with the name of the sister currently in control.",
    "history": "Orphaned by a powerful warlord, the sisters were trained in tactics and combat. After a victory celebration, the two sisters set out to kill the other and a massacre occurred, leaving one sister dead. Both claim to be the survivor, with the other a parasitic spirit. They now seek the power at the Estate to rid themselves of the other.",
