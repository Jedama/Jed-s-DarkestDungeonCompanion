  "summary": "The Plague Doctor, is primarily driven by her fervor to practice medicine and unlock the secrets of life and death.

Her breakthrough came when she revived the cadaver of her deceased professor during an unauthorized experiment. Haunted by the consequences of her actions, she was compelled to leave her former life behind, seeking refuge and opportunity in the shadows of the hamlet's resources.",
