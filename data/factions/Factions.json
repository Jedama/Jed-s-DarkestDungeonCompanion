        "description": "Once mercenaries hired by the Ancestor to suppress a rebellion in the Hamlet, the Brigands are a ruthless band of hardened bandits and killers. Following the Ancestor's demise and the cessation of their payments, they have turned to banditry, exploiting the chaos surrounding the estate. No quarter is expected from them, nor should any be given.",
        "appearance": "The brigands are a ruthless and hardened group of mercenaries turned bandits, identifiable by their rugged, piecemeal armor and distinctive green hoods. Some are heavily armored, with fur-lined accents and wolf pelts, suggesting higher rank or specialization. Their attire and gear are practical and worn, reflecting a life of constant combat and survival."
