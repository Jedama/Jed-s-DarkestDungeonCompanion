Base the number of consequences and their severity based on the outcome. Ensure that each consequence is justified based on the outcome and the character's actions or thoughts in the scene. List the consequences in a format ready for script execution.

            - For each character, start with the character's title followed by their name in parenthesis and a colon.
            - List each consequence command on a new line below the character's title.
            - Each command should begin with the action, followed by the parameters in parentheses.
            - Always refer to characters by their title.
            - Only select consequences clearly stated or implied in the attached vignette.
            - Neutral outcome = max 1 consequence per character. Good/bad outcome = max 2 consequences per character. Horrible/excellent outcome = max 3 consequences per character.
            - If there are no consequences for a character, proceed immediately to "For [next title (name)]".
