This is the beginnings of my darkest dungeon companion that aims to help make the characters, stories, and relationships more vivid and interesting.
The companion is also meant to impose restrictions, poor character stats and relations causing tension in discussions.

Current features
4 characters
Can generate short flavour stories (happenings) that cause consequences (such as stat and trait updates)
