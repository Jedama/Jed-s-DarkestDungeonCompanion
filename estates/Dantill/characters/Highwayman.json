    "summary": "Once a prisoner, the Highwayman is now a haunted fugitive, living off the squalor of the city's canals and the meager pickings from vermin. His vision of freedom has been replaced by a reality of degradation, driving him to reluctantly offer his services for a final, desperate heist. Now, his path has unexpectedly converged with that of the Heiress and the Heir, offering a precarious chance at redemption through service.",
    "history": "The Highwayman's tale is one of escape and survival, painted with strokes of desperation and grim resolve. Escaping from incarceration during a prison riot, he sought refuge in the underbelly of the city, subsisting in conditions that stripped away his illusions of freedom. A final job, taken out of sheer necessity, ended in tragedy, leaving him with a burden of guilt that no distance can alleviate.",
